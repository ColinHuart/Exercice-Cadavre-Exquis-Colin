#The bird who cannot fly
In a country far far away, where the trees touched the sky, where the cloud was pink and where the chocolate was actually called "troimion", there was a little bird, who was called by the name of "Patrick". He was particular, because he was the only one of his litter who was born without wings. Nobody wanted to ear of him. His parents, brothers and sisters abandoned him when they left nest. Even the human living in the house next the nest didn't want to eat him.
