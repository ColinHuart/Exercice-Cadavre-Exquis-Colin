#The bird who cannot fly
In a country far far away, where the trees touched the sky, where the cloud was pink and where the chocolate was actually called "troimion", there was a little bird, who was called by the name of "Patrick". He was particular, because he was the only one of his litter who was born without wings. Nobody wanted to ear of him. His parents, brothers and sisters abandoned him when they left nest. Even the human living in the house next the nest didn't want to eat him.

#The bird who started to fly

One day, in the morning, he saw a pretty bird flying with its beautiful flies... It was so beautiful that Patrick from a far far away country was so hyped by it that it wanted to follow the female bird. It jumped of its roof and started flying. But a car came and... paf. Paf the bird.

Suddenly, when the bird felt his body join the afterlife, he saw his bird family, his bird friends... When he realized that he was flying in a dream, he woke up with a start and dropped the eggs from his nest on the ground...

The eggs exploded. Fortunately, no drama, the baby birds were born a few days before. Patrick's female tried to fix the mistake and put them all back in the nest.
