# The bird who cannot fly
In a country far far away, where the trees touched the sky, where the cloud was pink and where the chocolate was actually called "troimion", there was a little bird, who was called by the name of "Patrick". He was particular, because he was the only one of his litter who was born without wings. Nobody wanted to ear of him. His parents, brothers and sisters abandoned him when they left nest. Even the human living in the house next the nest didn't want to eat him.


# The bird who started to fly

One day, in the morning, he saw a pretty bird flying with its beautiful flies... It was so beautiful that Patrick from a far far away country was so hyped by it that it wanted to follow the female bird. It jumped of its roof and started flying. But a car came and... paf. Paf the bird.

Suddenly, when the bird felt his body join the afterlife, he saw his bird family, his bird friends... When he realized that he was flying in a dream, he woke up with a start and dropped the eggs from his nest on the ground...

The eggs exploded. Fortunately, no drama, the baby birds were born a few days before. Patrick's female tried to fix the mistake and put them all back in the nest.

# The bird who got cheated on

To make sure their babies were okay, Patrick and his baby mama went to the birds hospital to run some tests.
**This is when the sad and cruel truth exploded.**
The babies weren't his, neither hers. They were babies cuckoos. And Patrick's future wife was a liar who pretended to be their mom so she could be with him forever.
Patrick felt betrayed, first he experienced a near death experience, and now his children are cuckoos'ones ? That was way too much.
He went to therapy a few months to talk about all of this. 
At the end of the journey, he decided that nothing was that deep, and that he could accept the children and a lovely girlfriends. *After all, cuckoos are really bad parents.*
They went through the adoption procedure as wife and husbands and everything went well.
*Now they live happily ever after.*

**_Moral of the story: everything can go wrong in your life but therapy is a good thing I guess (the moral is not to adopt children please don't do this)**
Hidden moral of the story: cuckoos are cruel_
